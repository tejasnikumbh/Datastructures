Insertion
To make sure that the given tree remains AVL after every insertion, we must augment the standard BST insert operation to perform some re-balancing. Following are two basic operations that can be performed to re-balance a BST without violating the BST property (keys(left) < key(root) < keys(right)).
1) Left Rotation
2) Right Rotation

T1, T2 and T3 are subtrees of the tree rooted with y (on left side) 
or x (on right side)           
                y                               x
               / \     Right Rotation          /  \
              x   T3   – - – - – - – >        T1   y 
             / \       < - - - - - - -            / \
            T1  T2     Left Rotation            T2  T3
Keys in both of the above trees follow the following order 
      keys(T1) < key(x) < keys(T2) < key(y) < keys(T3)
So BST property is not violated anywhere.

Steps to follow for insertion
Let the newly nserted node be w
1) Perform standard BST insert for w.
2) Starting from w, travel up and find the first unbalanced node. Let z be the first unbalanced node, y be the child of z that comes on the path from w to z and x be the grandchild of z that comes on the path from w to z.
3) Re-balance the tree by performing appropriate rotations on the subtree rooted with z. There can be 4 possible cases that needs to be handled as x, y and z can be arranged in 4 ways. Following are the possible 4 arrangements:
a) y is left child of z and x is left child of y (Left Left Case)
b) y is left child of z and x is right child of y (Left Right Case)
c) y is right child of z and x is right child of y (Right Right Case)
d) y is right child of z and x is left child of y (Right Left Case)

Following are the operations to be performed in above mentioned 4 cases. In all of the cases, we only need to re-balance the subtree rooted with z and the complete tree becomes balanced as the height of subtree (After appropriate rotations) rooted with z becomes same as it was before insertion. (See this video lecture for proof)

a) Left Left Case

T1, T2, T3 and T4 are subtrees.
         z                                      y 
        / \                                   /   \
       y   T4      Right Rotate (z)          x      z
      / \          - - - - - - - - ->      /  \    /  \ 
     x   T3                               T1  T2  T3  T4
    / \
  T1   T2

b) Left Right Case

     z                               z                           x
    / \                            /   \                        /  \ 
   y   T4  Left Rotate (y)        x    T4  Right Rotate(z)    y      z
  / \      - - - - - - - - ->    /  \      - - - - - - - ->  / \    / \
T1   x                          y    T3                    T1  T2 T3  T4
    / \                        / \
  T2   T3                    T1   T2

c) Right Right Case

  z                                y
 /  \                            /   \ 
T1   y     Left Rotate(z)       z      x
    /  \   - - - - - - - ->    / \    / \
   T2   x                     T1  T2 T3  T4
       / \
     T3  T4

d) Right Left Case

   z                            z                            x
  / \                          / \                          /  \ 
T1   y   Right Rotate (y)    T1   x      Left Rotate(z)   z      x
    / \  - - - - - - - - ->     /  \   - - - - - - - ->  / \    / \
   x   T4                      T2   y                  T1  T2  T3  T4
  / \                              /  \
